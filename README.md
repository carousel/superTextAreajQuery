This is HTML textarea element  on steroids, with some custom configuration options and a character counter. It is written in coffescript, and compiled to native JS.

Todo:
    - add options for db communication
    - add support for web-sockets ( in order to create real front-end chat client )
    - refactor everything cause it can be better I am sure :)
